/*

thread.h
-------------

First we create a variable to hold a sleep tick count, which will denote how long the thread shall sleep
before being woken-up/unblocked:

int sleep_ticks;

We create a variable to act as our container for holding a list of sleeping threads:

struct list sleeping_threads;

thread.c
-------------

We create a new field within the thread struct/TCB that holds a reason for why a thread is blocked; we'll call
it "enum thread_block_reason":

enum thread_block_reason{

	BLOCK_REASON_SLEEP = 0,
	BLOCK_REASON_OTHER,
};

The existing "thread_status" enum will indicate whenever the thread is blocked while its value is THREAD_BLOCKED.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

/*

In our new timer_sleep implementation, we prepare the currently-executing thread to go to sleep by
first setting the thread_status to THREAD_BLOCKED and then setting the reason for the thread block
to BLOCK_REASON_SLEEPING. We then specify the sleep time of the thread to be equal to the value of
"ticks", which must be greater than 0, and then supply a pointer to the thread into our container
of sleeping threads.

In our new timer_interrupt implementation, we prepare by continually/repeatedly fetching the first item
in our container of sleeping threads (which, by design, will be the the thread that is to be unblocked next,
if any), check said thread's tick value and compare it to our global tick count, and remove the delete the thread
from the container of sleeping threads and unblock it if and only if its tick value is less than or equal to the
global tick count. The aforementioned process is repeated until either the fetched thread's tick count (from our
sleep container) is greater than our global tick count, or, our container of sleeping threads is empty. Finally,
once we have a thread who's tick count is greater than our global tick count (or our sleeping thread list was either
empty or emptied), we check once more if the current thread still has the highest priority, compared to any other
threads that may have been unblocked.


*/

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

/*

The scheduling scheme we have devised involves storing all threads that are to sleep in a container
and sorting them by their desired sleep time, from shortest to longest. From there, the scheduler
can select the next thread to run which has the shortest sleep time, by checking the first element of
the container. By contrast, if the container is empty, no threads are sleeping and waiting to be woken
up. By this design, the time_interrupt handler traverses a container containing only sleeping threads,
and needs only to check one item (which is the first) in the list, making it an operation computable
in O(1) time.

*/

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

/*

Prior to any critical sections in our design, such as our container of sleeping threads, interrupts are
to be disabled so as to prevent such race conditions.

*/

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

/*

Within the timer_sleep method, we will be disabling interrupts immediately prior to all critical sections,
such as the timer_sleep() call. And since interrupts are disabled, it is not possible for any other interrupt
to take place.

*/

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

/*

Taking into account discussions from lectures and recitations, we decided that this design seemed to be the
simplest yet most efficient way for this task, as any distant other possibilities that we could think of seemed
to be less efficient overall.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING

/*

For our priority scheduling implementation, which must handle priority donation for threads and locks, we will
have to keep track of several pieces of information, including start/original priorities, donations, inherited
priorities, a lock to keep track of any applicable lock that the thread may or may not be waiting on, ... [TODO]

thread.h
-------------

int priority;				/* Start/original priority of the thread. */
struct list donations;			/* Locks this thread has that others are waiting for. */
struct list inherited_priorities;	/* Priorities inherited from donations. */

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you

choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
